Overview
++++++++

This lab will introduce the Prism Element UI, and familiarize you with its layout and navigation.

Prism Element
+++++++++++++

The Prism service provides the web UI for managing Nutanix clusters and runs on every Controller VM (CVM). This local Prism service, referred to Prism Element, can be accessed via the IP of any individual CVM, or via the virtual IP for the cluster, which will redirect to the current Prism leader.

From the Firefox web browser (preferred), log into the Nutanix Prism GUI using the Cluster IP.

#. Open \https://<*NUTANIX-CLUSTER-IP*>:9440 in a new browser tab.

#. Log in using the following credentials:

   - **Username** - admin
   - **Password** - *HPOC Password*

#. Review the Home screen, and identify the following items:

   - Hypervisor
   - Version
   - Hardware Model
   - Health
   - VM Summary
   - Warning Alerts
   - Data Resiliency Status

Prism Element UI Review
.......................

Where would you locate the version of AOS you are running?

.. figure:: images/nutanix_tech_overview_06.png

You can do this by clicking on the **User** drop down :fa:`user`, and clicking **About Nutanix**.

How would you get to the following screen to view a summary of the number of hosts (or nodes) and the resource capacity and current utilization?

.. figure:: images/nutanix_tech_overview_07.png

In **Prism > Hardware**, click **Hardware**, then click **Table**.

How would you get the following screen to see the health of your cluster?

.. figure:: images/nutanix_tech_overview_08.png

In **Prism > Health**, click **Health**, then click **Summary** in the right pane.

What page would show you the latest activity in the system? On this page, you can monitor the progress of any task and keep track of what has been done in the past using time stamps. Can you figure out two different ways to get there?

.. figure:: images/nutanix_tech_overview_09.png

From the View Options menu, select **Tasks**, or click the circle :fa:`circle-o` icon in the toolbar, to the right of the bell icon :fa:`bell`.

.. note::

  In ESXi:

  - The containers created in Prism appear as datastores in vCenter.

  Example view of storage containers from Prism:
